# Fizz Buzz in Python

My attempt learn how to use and test drive development in Python with the simple Fizz Buzz exercise.

## Testing

``
Number of tests: 11
``

``
Number of tests passed: 11
``
## TDD Steps

1.) Having installed Python 3.7 and Pytest, I set u a file named 'test_sample.py' to check that pytest is linked and is working. Having confirmed this I can begin to test drive the program.

2.) I have added fizzBuzz.py and fizzBuzz_test.py to the project prior to setting up this git repo. and in the initial commit these files are empty and ready to be written in.

3.) I began by writing a test to make 0 raise an error, then moved on to 1 returning 1.

4.) Added edge case tests for 0 and 101 into @staticmethod.

5.) Added @property and the 'result' method and passed tests one by one for returning numbers

6.) Finally, I changed the functionality of the 'result' method to return 'Fizz' when divisible by 3, 'Buzz' when divisible by 5 and 'FizzBuzz' when divisible by 3 and 5.

## Where I could go from here

If I continue on this project, my next step will be to seperate the 'divisible by' functionality into a seperate method that allows me to take out the magic numbers of the 'result method'.

## My thoughts on the project

I am very pleased with how this project has gone so far. Having spent the last few months learning Ruby and Javascript I wanted to start exploring Python, a language that I've been looking forward to learning. Thankfully it is somewhat similar in its syntax to Ruby, and hopefully it won't be too difficult for me to gain a deeper understanding of Python in the near future.
