# Fizz Buzz in Python

My attempt learn how to use and test drive development in Python with the simple Fizz Buzz exercise.

## Initial steps

1.) Having installed Python 3.7 and Pytest, I set u a file named 'test_sample.py' to check that pytest is linked and is working. Having confirmed this I can begin to test drive the program.

2.) I have added fizzBuzz.py and fizzBuzz_test.py to the project prior to setting up this git repo. and in the initial commit these files are empty and ready to be written in.
